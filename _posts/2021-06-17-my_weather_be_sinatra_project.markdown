As I like weather Stuff, my Sinatra project was an extension and improvement of my CLI Project. I kept working in refactoring the code and also adding some cool API's. 

The scope was to create a good user experience and great look. So the app allows you to check the weather at your location and find and update to any other location in the world. Also give you News of the day and a gallery of photos from the city you are connected. Once you Sign in and create an account you will be able to add different locations, modify and also delete them. 

[Check it out](https://github.com/JcBonassin/Weather_real) and have a look at the code. It might be fun.

What I learn: 

- APIs are fun to work with and also a great source of interesting data. 
- You can add some JS script if you dare to improve the user experience.
- Sinatra is simple to use and friendly. It was hard to find a lot of info online though. 
- It is kind of cool to work out of your comfort zone and add new stuff like JS. It will help you for your future projects.

Thanks for reading ..
